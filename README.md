# What I learned
I remember the very first time I saw "Hello World" showed up on the my screen, it was really amazing to see how you can code something and turn it into an actual content that everyone from around the world can be able to see and access it. Introduction to Git and GitHub was somewhat confusing at first, but the more and more I use it I am getting used to it. 

Started off as using floats for most of the layout and learning flexbox afterwards made so much more sense why I should be using flexbox to layout most of the content on the page. 

Using mixin and variables for Sass files are a bit confusing, but I would like to be able to use them in order to have cleaner and shorter code later on.
